                    You are one of the chillest and coolest tita we know.
                    You always try to help us in any way you can.
                    You may not know it, but you are one of the people we look up to. 
                    We aspire to be like you in the future, doing the things we loved 
                    while helping our families.

                Even when challenges arise, you handle them with patience and understanding. 
                You choose to be the bigger person, always seeking to bring peace rather than conflict, something we deeply respect and look up to.
                We know that being away from your family is not easy, yet you continue to work hard, make sacrifices, and still find ways to support and uplift us. 
                Even if we donâ€™t always say it out loud, please know that we see everything you do, and we appreciate you more than words can express.
                You deserve all the happiness, love, and success in the world. May your day be filled with joy, laughter, and everything that brings you peace. 
                We canâ€™t wait for the day we can celebrate together.
                Cheers to many more wonderful, fulfilling, and fabulous years ahead! ðŸ’–âœ¨
