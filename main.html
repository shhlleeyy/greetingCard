                    You are one of the chillest and coolest tita we know.
                    You always try to help us in any way you can.
                    You may not know it but you are one of the people we look up to. 
                    We aspire to be like you in the future, doing the things we loved 
                    while helping our families.

                Of course, misunderstandings are inevitable but I admire how you always try to be the bigger person. 
                I know life away from your family is hard but you still continue to work hard and help us.
                We may not be vocal with our feelings but always remember that we appreciate you and we see you.
                May your day be filled with love, laughter, and all the things that make you smile. 
                You deserve all the happiness in the world. Hoping we can celebrate your birthday together soon.
                Cheers to many more fabulous years ahead!
